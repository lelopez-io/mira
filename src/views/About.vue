    <p>
      Mira is the spanish word for look, as in look at what your friends are
      watching. The idea is to see what your friends are watching, have watched,
      or stopped watching while browsing through titles. This idea could be
      extended to include messages both public and private with the option to
      filter out possible spoilers.
